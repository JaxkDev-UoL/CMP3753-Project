# CMP3753-Project - Action Tokens in LLM's

This repository stores the main brain of my project:
- Finetuning Llama models
- Running inference on finetuned models.

Required dependencies such as datasets and models can be found below:

Datasets:
- `MCV` @ [CMP3753-Project-MCV](https://github.com/JaxkDev-UOL/CMP3753-Project-MCV)
- `ABCD` @ [CMP3753-Project-ABCD](https://github.com/JaxkDev-UOL/CMP3753-Project-ABCD)

Models:
- `Llama 3.1 8B Instruct` @ [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct/)
- `Llama 3.1 8B` @ [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B/)
